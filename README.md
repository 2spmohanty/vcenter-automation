# vCenter Automation :  Rest In Peak

The Plan is to create an Automation Platform that could handle Automation of vCenter Tasks in a Large scale. 
The Rest In Peak Application provides a subtle way of Automation. It gives a friendly UI for the UI lovers while it also exposes REST endpoints for those who like to handle automation by writing codes.
This application can be used to trigger Automation on Multiple vCenters simultaneously.
